# F.E.L.D
### Humanity stole the sun; now it's taking its revenge.
A catastrophic solar flare wreaks havoc to humanity's greatest asset: the dyson sphere that powers the economy (and a few less important things, like the continued existence of the human race).

Work "with" the Federal Energy Logistics Divison to survive the fall of the Lux market, trading your way into a government-run Habitat before our self-imposed economical doomsday.

A command-line trading simulation game written in Python for Week 8 of Hack Club's Siege program.

## Usage
Download `src/feld/main.py` and run it with `python main.py`. If you're in a hurry or want virtualization, you may install the game via `pip install feld`.

## Lore
You don't need to read this, but it helps understand the game. Also accessible in-game via the `lore` command.

In the year 2077, an asteroid known as 529556 Cabeiri was discovered inside a pocket of dust halfway to Proxima Centauri. Inside, scans revealed a huge mound of a previously undiscovered stable isotope of francium, sparking waves in the scientific community. It appears to be useful in many ways — first and foremost, its uncanny ability to fold outward as if it were as thin as paper whilst also absorbing solar energy. Scientists attempted to convince people to switch to panels on their homes, but people are stubborn; instead, we turned to the source.

By 2108, scientists had prototyped and launched an interstellar probe. It was designed to attach to Cabeiri and extract Francium-339 whilst operating on power harvested from an RTG. The probe, nicknamed Gaia, then built tiny panels with tiny solar sails that would propel them to our sun and unfold, eventually forming a huge Dyson Sphere around Sol.

In 2112, construction completed, and shipments of physical batteries (also made from francium) began periodically coming in from what we decided to name the Sol Ark. Occasional solar flares forced Gaia to replace panels, but the RTG retained just enough power to keep the Sol Ark active and producing power.

However, in the year 2195, a massive gash in the power delivery part of the Sol Ark formed after a particularly large solar flare. The RTG in Gaia had finally failed, and since we no longer had the exact parts needed to rebuild it, we were forced to send a new probe. Very quickly, a new probe was designed, constructed, and sent — but we were working with tiny amounts of power (which we call Lux) left. The probe has around a year left in its journey, so we just need to survive until it can get there and begin producing the very fast-moving Ark fragments.

However, humanity doesn't like making things easy for itself. We had started trading things with Lux (our power) as a type of currency — now that no more could be produced, the market (and thus people's supplies) was collapsing, resulting in the fall of capitalism.

Enter the Federal Energy Logistics Division, or F.E.L.D. Their job was to mediate the Lux market, but it is now to provide access to the habitats that the government had created. F.E.L.D. realized it needed a source of revenue, so what better way to get it than to force potential habitat-dwellers to trade stocks for them in hopes that they would earn a place to live whilst the Sol Ark was repopulated.

As a F.E.L.D. employee, you must secure your ticket in while surviving the fall of the market brought on by humanity's foolish decisions.
